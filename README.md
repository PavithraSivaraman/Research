# Sentiment Analysis of Customer Feedback

## Abstract
Sentiment analysis of customer feedback is a pivotal component of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling businesses to gauge consumer emotions towards their products and services. The inherent variability of language introduces substantial challenges in the analysis of unstructured customer data.  

To address these challenges, this research presents an innovative hybrid model that amalgamates **RoBERTa, ResNeXt, BiLSTM, and self-attention mechanisms**. This integration capitalizes on the collective strengths of these models to surmount the limitations inherent in each. The proposed model proves to be a powerful and efficient tool for sentiment analysis, demonstrating proficiency across various data types and tasks.  

We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model’s **accuracy and training efficiency** using four benchmark datasets, and explore the impact of different similarity measures and convolutional neural network architectures. Results affirm that our model not only achieves high accuracy but also significantly reduces training time compared to RoBERTa’s fine-tuning. Furthermore, it exhibits exceptional **domain adaptability**, particularly when fine-tuned on the IMDb dataset following initial training on the Yelp Review Full dataset.  

The practicality of the proposed model is underscored by its reduced computational complexity and its adeptness at navigating semantic and syntactic nuances.
